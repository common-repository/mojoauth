MojoAuth provides a secure and delightful experience to your customer with passwordless. Here, you'll find comprehensive guides and documentation to help you to start working with MojoAuth APIs.

== Description ==

The [MojoAuth](https://mojoauth.com) Passwordless Authentication WordPress plugin replaces standard WordPress login forms with the passwordless authentication method. It provides a robust and secure passwordless authentication mechanism to your WordPress site that offers the users a way to verify themselves while not having to remember or manually type passwords, which in turn provides stronger security and fewer breaches.

Adding a passwordless authentication mechanism will help to create additional barriers to secure accounts of users. We updated the conventional password method of login with a safer authentication method, for example, log in through Email OTP, Magic Link, Social Login, Phone SMS and WebAuthn. This likewise cuts the additional progression of you fumbling over your failed to remember password.

### KEY FEATURES

 - **Magic Link**: A unique link sent directly to your email which allows you to authenticate once and becomes invalid automatically once you are logged in.
 - **OTP**: A unique OTP sent directly to your email which allows you to authenticate once and becomes invalid automatically once you are logged in.
 - **WebAuthn**: Allow users to authenticate with built-in authenticators like fingerprint, pin, or using security keys like YubiKey.
 - **Social Login**: Allow your users to log in using Social login like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc., and increase sign-ups by removing the friction of passwords.
 - **SMS Authentication**: Authenticate and verify your users using SMS OTP across all your applications and enable a secure, frictionless and customizable login experience for everyone.
